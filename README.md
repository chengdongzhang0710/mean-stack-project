# Mean Stack Project

This project uses Angular as frontend framework, Express.js as backend framework, and MongoDB as database to build a simple blog website.

The frontend was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.7, and styles with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

The backend works with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to interact with database.

This blog website can achieve two major functions:

* User authentication and authorization;

* Post create, read, update and delete.
